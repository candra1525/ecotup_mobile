&emsp;Weâ€™re trying to solve bad trash management that has been in Indonesia for many years now. The public still littering at the side of the road and not sorting their trash are a couple of reasons why Indonesia has such bad trash management. Ecotup is a service application that can be used to call a service to help you throw your trash with just a press of a button. With this application, we are hoping to improve public awareness with the reward system and the project can also answer problems on how to solve littering and laziness of throwing trash in Indonesia.
